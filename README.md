# Coords_Converter

This repository contains the coordinate converters I've written many years ago as an attempt to provide a Fortran-friendly map projection library.

It's just useful code. To date, many better implementations exist, which are also standard. My advice is using them, and resorting to my modules only if a quick-and-dirty solution is to be found.
